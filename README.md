# Breast Cancer Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign. The goal is to compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective model for this classification task.

## Key Features
- **Dataset**: The project uses a breast cancer dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset/data
- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Naive Bayes
- **Metrics Used**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - ROC-AUC

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness of the cell nuclei. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is **malignant** or **benign**.

### Dataset Structure
- **Features**: Numerical attributes derived from image processing.
- **Target**: Binary label (0 for benign, 1 for malignant).

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Normalized numerical features for algorithms sensitive to scaling.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Implemented five machine learning algorithms.
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning using grid search or cross-validation.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Compared model performance using the defined metrics.
   - Visualized results with confusion matrices and ROC curves.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Results
- Each algorithmâ€™s performance is summarized in a comparison table and corresponding visualizations.
- Insights into the effectiveness of each algorithm for breast cancer classification are discussed.
